1. Install dev dependencies (optional but recommended):

```
npm install
```

2. Run a live-reload server (opens the site):

```
npm run dev
```

3. Or run a simple static preview server:

```
npm run preview
```

4. Then open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser.

Notes:
- `npm run dev` uses `live-server` for auto-reload while editing.
- `npm run preview` uses `serve` for a lightweight static server.
